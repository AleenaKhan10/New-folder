### CHAPTER 1, 2 ###

There are three types of outputs;

1- qunatitative outputs
2- qualitative output
3- clustering outputs


Quantitative - measureable output - when you can put a numerical output
Qualitative - classifications based on description - categories
Clustering - where things can be grouped on the basis of some common quatitative/qualitative parameters


There are predictions and inferences in statistics;

Predictions - refers to guesses about what will happen in the future - if x happen what would be the result y
Inferences - refers to the relationship between two variables - if x change with the value of 1 what's gonna be the effect on y


There is supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

Supervised Learning - Training model with labeled data. We have both the answers and questions
Unsupervised Learning - Training model without labeled data. We have only question and answers are predicted by the model it self.


There are scalar outputs and categorical outputs.


Mean Square Error (MSE) - Measures difference between predicted and actual reponses


### CHAPTER 3 ###

Linear Regression

y = m(x)

chart ->
independent param always on x axis
dependent param always on y axis
